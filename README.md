# BookLocal
This repo contains a proof of concept for a hotel PMS system using smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain. It uses ERC721 to establish rooms as non-fungible tokens (NFT) and ERC809 to interface with rental features. To interact, clone the repo, run "truffle compile" from the command line, remove the appropriate bytecode from the build folder, and release to the network of your choice using myetherwallet.com.

For an version with a user interface, please visit the [BookLocal](https://github.com/BookLocal/EthMemphis) repository, clone, and run npm start from the command line.
