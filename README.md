# BookLocal
This repo contains a proof of concept for a hotel PMS system. It uses ERC721 to interface with contracts as a non-fungible token (NFT) and ERC809 to interface with renting and accessing rival NFT's. For an up to date version of these contracts, please visit the (BookLocal)[https://github.com/BookLocal/EthMemphis] repository. This version adds an interface to the core contracts and will be used by select participants at the EthMemphis business hackathon.
